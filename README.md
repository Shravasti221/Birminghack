Imagine reading a story where Morgan Freeman narrates, Robert Downey Jr. delivers the punchlines, and Scarlett Johansson voices the heroine—all at your command.

As firm believers of the power of words, we believe that everyone deserves to experience the magic of legendary voices and unforgettable words.

We thus build StoryPhonic, an AI-powered storytelling app that breathes life into text by extracting characters, identifying dialogues, and assigning famous voices to each role—all chosen by the user. Whether it’s a classic novel, a fan fiction, or your own screenplay, StoryPhonic transforms written words into a fully immersive audio experience.

StoryPhonic is built to have the following features:

AI-Driven Voice Casting – Choose from a library of celebrity and iconic voices.
Dynamic Dialogue Extraction – Automatically detects characters and attributes the right voice.
Realistic AI Speech Synthesis – Experience ultra-realistic narration with expressive voices.
Export & Share – Turn your text into an audiobook, podcast, or social media content.
From conceptualizing the project, to building it block by block, it was a rollercoaster of a journey. Like all things that make you feel frustrated in one moment and content the next, it was a great learning journey. We first decided a rough plan of action and divided the tasks among team members; while one person worked on figuring out the APIs, other people struggled with fixing the interface and finding the right prompt. We learnt to use different tools to suit our needs and appreciated how one can go about working in a team to do tasks that individually seem not-so-attainable.

In the end, we were able to build something that we truly loved bringing to life, and thus introduce you to StoryPhonic. Whether you’re an author, a screenwriter, a podcaster, or just a storytelling enthusiast, StoryPhonic lets your words be heard in the voices of legends.

Turn your text into a star-studded performance. With StoryPhonic, your stories don’t just get told—they get performed.

Are you ready to make your words legendary?
