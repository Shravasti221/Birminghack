The girl went out to her mother's grave every day and wept, and she remained pious and good. When winter came the snow spread a white cloth over the grave, and when the spring sun had removed it again, the man took himself another wife. Narrator: This wife brought two daughters into the house with her. They were beautiful, with fair faces, but evil and dark hearts. Stepsister1: \"Why should that stupid goose sit in the parlor with us?\" Stepsister2: \"If she wants to eat bread, then she will have to earn it. Out with this kitchen maid!\" Narrator: They took her beautiful clothes away from her, dressed her in an old gray smock, and gave her wooden shoes. Stepsister1: \"Just look at the proud princess! How decked out she is!\" Stepsister2: \"Just look at the proud princess! Narrator: They shouted and laughed as they led her into the kitchen. There she had to do hard work from morning until evening, get up before daybreak, carry water, make the fires, cook, and wash. \n",
