(Cinderella, stepsisters, stepmother, father, prince, pigeons, turtledoves, bird)

Narrator: A rich man's wife became sick, and when she felt that her end was drawing near, she called her only daughter to her bedside and said, 

Mother: Dear child, remain pious and good, and then our dear God will always protect you, and I will look down on you from heaven and be near you.

Narrator: With this she closed her eyes and died. The girl went out to her mother's grave every day and wept, and she remained pious and good. When winter came the snow spread a white cloth over the grave, and when the spring sun had removed it again, the man took himself another wife. This wife brought two daughters into the house with her. They were beautiful, with fair faces, but evil and dark hearts.

Stepsisters: Why should that stupid goose sit in the parlor with us? If she wants to eat bread, then she will have to earn it. Out with this kitchen maid!

Narrator: They took her beautiful clothes away from her, dressed her in an old gray smock, and gave her wooden shoes.

Stepsisters: Just look at the proud princess! How decked out she is!

Narrator: They led her into the kitchen. There she had to do hard work from morning until evening, get up before daybreak, carry water, make the fires, cook, and wash. Besides this, the sisters did everything imaginable to hurt her. They made fun of her, scattered peas and lentils into the ashes for her, so that she had to sit and pick them out again.

Father: I am going to the fair, and I want to know what you would like me to bring back for you.

Stepsister 1: Beautiful dresses.

Stepsister 2: Pearls and jewels.

Father: And you, Cinderella, what do you want?

Cinderella: Father, break off for me the first twig that brushes against your hat on your way home.

Narrator: So he bought beautiful dresses, pearls, and jewels for his two stepdaughters. On his way home, as he was riding through a green thicket, a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat. Then he broke off the twig and took it with him. Arriving home, he gave his stepdaughters the things that they had asked for, and he gave Cinderella the twig from the hazel bush.

Cinderella: Thank you, Father.

Narrator: Cinderella went to her mother's grave, planted the branch on it, and wept so much that her tears fell upon it and watered it. It grew and became a beautiful tree. Cinderella went to this tree three times every day, and beneath it she wept and prayed. A white bird came to the tree every time, and whenever she expressed a wish, the bird would throw down to her what she had wished for.

Stepsisters: Comb our hair for us. Brush our shoes and fasten our buckles. We are going to the festival at the king's castle.

Cinderella: I will obey, but I too would have liked to go to the dance with them.

Cinderella: I beg of you, stepmother, to allow me to go.

Stepmother: You, Cinderella? You, all covered with dust and dirt, and you want to go to the festival? You have neither clothes nor shoes, and yet you want to dance!

Cinderella: But please, stepmother, I want to go.

Stepmother: I have scattered a bowl of lentils into the ashes for you. If you can pick them out again in two hours, then you may go with us.

Narrator: The girl went through the back door into the garden, and called out, 

Cinderella: You tame pigeons, you turtledoves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come and help me to gather: The good ones go into the pot, The bad ones go into your crop.

Narrator: Two white pigeons came in through the kitchen window, and then the turtledoves, and finally all the birds beneath the sky came whirring and swarming in, and lit around the ashes. The pigeons nodded their heads and began to pick, pick, pick, pick. And the others also began to pick, pick, pick, pick. They gathered all the good grains into the bowl.

Stepmother: No, Cinderella, you have no clothes, and you don't know how to dance. Everyone would only laugh at you.

Cinderella: But please, stepmother, I want to go.

Stepmother: You may go if you are able to pick two bowls of lentils out of the ashes for me in one hour.

Narrator: The girl went through the back door into the garden, and called out, 

Cinderella: You tame
