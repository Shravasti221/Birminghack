Narrator: The hills across the valley of the Ebro* were long and white. On this side there was no shade and no trees and the station was between two lines of rails in the sun. Close against the side of the station there was the warm shadow of the building and a curtain, made of strings of bamboo beads, hung across the open door into the bar, to keep out flies. The American and the girl with him sat at a table in the shade, outside the building. It was very hot and the express from Barcelona would come in forty minutes. It stopped at this junction for two minutes and went on to Madrid.

Girl: What should we drink?

Narrator: She had taken off her hat and put it on the table.

American: It's pretty hot.

Girl: Let's drink beer.

American: Dos cervezas.

Narrator: He said into the curtain.

Woman: Big ones?

American: Yes. Two big ones.

Narrator: The woman brought two glasses of beer and two felt pads. She put the felt pads and the beer glasses on the table and looked at the man and the girl. The girl was looking off at the line of hills. They were white in the sun and the country was brown and dry.

Girl: They look like white elephants.

American: I've never seen one. * He drank his beer.

Girl: No, you wouldn't have.

American: Maybe I might have. Just because you say I wouldn't have doesn't prove anything.

Girl: I think they've painted something on it. What does it say?

Narrator: She looked at the bead curtain.

American: Anis del Toro. It's a drink.
